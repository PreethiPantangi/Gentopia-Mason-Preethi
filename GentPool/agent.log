INFO:root:The Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at George Mason University is a research group that focuses on the study and development of computational models of human language understanding. The group is part of the larger Department of Computer Science.

The NLP group conducts research in various areas of natural language processing, including information extraction, text mining, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering systems. They use techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and data mining to develop algorithms and systems that can understand, generate, and respond to human language in a natural and meaningful way.

The group is composed of faculty members, graduate students, and undergraduate students who collaborate on various research projects. They publish their research findings in top-tier conferences and journals in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

The NLP group also offers courses and training in natural language processing, machine learning, and related areas, providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to pursue careers or further research in this field.
