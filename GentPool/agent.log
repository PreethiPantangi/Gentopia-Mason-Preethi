INFO:root:I'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to personal data about individuals unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I am designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, I can't provide the list of members who are part of the NLP group at George Mason University. I recommend visiting the official website of George Mason University or contacting them directly for this information.
